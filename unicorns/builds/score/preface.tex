\textbf{The last}
\href{https://www.unicornsparty.com/}{\textbf{Unicorns} Party} was when
I reconnected with a person who has been very special to me in these
couple of years.  They gave me pointers at a time when I was feeling
lost. I wouldn't have met so many people and friends, been to places
previously unheard of, nor would I have understood myself the way I do
now, if it was not for them. For that, I am grateful. I thought I shall
write a piece dedicated to the moment where we saw each other again.
