# Ideas

Things to explore:
- Chords
- Lines with space in between
- High notes and low notes
- (Semi-)regular rhythm
- pitch generation with interval depended distribution
- dynamic generation with interval depended distribution
- dynamics
- separate seeds for pitch generation, arrival instance generation, duration generation, and dynamic generation

TODO:
- sometimes there are chords that contains say, both c and c-sharp
  - maybe create a function that makes it into c and d-flat
- make it easier to debug
  - add logs
